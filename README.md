# DistributedLogAnalysis

This project simulates distributed log analysis using JavaScript for the frontend interface, Python for backend processing, and Go for performance-critical log aggregation.

## Structure

- **JavaScript**: Handles the frontend interface.
- **Python**: Manages backend processing and communication with the database.
- **Go**: Handles performance-critical log aggregation.

## Setup

### JavaScript
1. Install dependencies:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
2. Build and run the JavaScript code:
    ```
    npm run start
    ```

### Python
1. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Run the Python application:
    ```
    flask run
    ```

### Go
1. Build and run the Go code:
    ```
    go run main.go
    ```

## Overview

1. JavaScript provides a user interface for displaying and interacting with log data.
2. Python manages backend processing and communicates with the database.
3. Go handles performance-critical log aggregation and processing.
